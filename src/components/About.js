                            My objective has always been to work in an environment where technical skills and creative endeavor function harmoniously in delivering a useful product or service to the end user.
                        <br /><br />
I have 12+ years of working with both front-end and back-end programming. Currently based in Wicklow/Dublin, I work as a full stack developer for Sentient Solutions where my role is to lead the ongoing development of Scorebuddy, Flightbuddy and Surveybuddy; three successful cloud based technologies. I am highly motivated, take great pride in the quality of my work and I love to turn innovative ideas into great products.
<br /><br />
I am a multi-disciplined developer, with an equal knowledge of both the back-end technologies and user interface and experience methodologies involved in successful software production.

                            <p>Scorebuddy is Sentientâ€™s flagship product. It is an award winning software used in contact and service centers worldwide to measure the performance of Customer Service Representatives and other staff who handle omni-channel customer interactions (such as calls, chat, email). This is generally referred to as Quality Assessment (QA).</p>
                            <p>As the original developer on this project, I was responsible for the planning, architecting, development and testing of the first version. As the product has grown in popularity and the client base has expanded to over 100 companies and 15,000 users, so has the team around me. My current role is as lead developer on a team of ten, tasked with the upkeep, expansion, releases and security of the product.</p>

                            <p>Flightbuddy is a customer service communications platform that automatically alerts passengers of flight delays, cancellations or diversions in multiple languages via SMS and email. Flightbuddy is secure, reliable, scaled for mass disruptions and uses real-time flight data as well as integrating with the airlines booking system to give passengers an alert containing meaningful, accurate and timely information.</p>
                            <p>I was involved in the early stages of this product's design and development. Paired with a Java developer who would look after the core functions, I took the role of UX lead. I worked closely with the customer to ensure we developed a product that delivered an excellent user experience.</p>

                                Surveybuddy is a product which helps contact centres gather feedback from their customer experiences. This tool allows you to build surveys, distribute via SMS or Email and report back on the  customer feedback. All of these metric can be linked back to the agent and display the overall performance metrics on their dashboard. This was a solo project initiated by a whiteboard session, which became a fully formed product that in now part of the Sentient product offering.

                                Over the years I designed and developed several micro-sites for a large airline company operating in the Irish market. This included landing pages to handle baggage loss, customer contact / refund management applications and employee award nominations. These pages had high volumes of customer traffic, so needed to be designed and optimised to ensure ease of use and align to accessibility standards.
